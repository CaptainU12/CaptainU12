- 👋 Hi, I’m @CaptainU12
- 👀 I’m interested in Nintendo console modding, including modding the 3DS, Wii, Wii U.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create my own homebrew software by myself, experience gives skills, ya know?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, really. I look out for new WiiLink24 and RiiConnect24 updates so I can give feedback.
